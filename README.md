a. **Project Description**:
   The project demonstrates the use of Web Workers to perform complex calculations efficiently in a web application. Specifically, it calculates prime numbers within a user-defined range and displays them on the webpage dynamically. By offloading the computation to a Web Worker, the application ensures a responsive user interface even during intensive calculations.

b. **Instructions to Run the Project Locally**:
   1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
   2. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
   3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
   4. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
   5. Start a local web server using a tool like `http-server`.
   6. Access the project by opening the provided local server URL in your web browser.

c. **Summary of Performance Improvements**:
   Using Web Workers significantly improves the responsiveness of the web application during prime number calculations. By moving the computation to a separate thread, the main UI thread remains unblocked, allowing users to interact with the application without delays. This ensures a smoother user experience, especially for intensive tasks like finding prime numbers in large ranges.

d. **Challenges Faced and Solutions**:
   - **Web Worker Setup**: One challenge was configuring the Web Worker script and ensuring proper communication between the main thread and the worker. This was addressed by carefully implementing message passing between the main thread and the Web Worker.
   - **Cross-Origin Restrictions**: Initially, attempting to load the Web Worker script directly from the file system resulted in cross-origin errors. This was resolved by serving the project files from a local web server, adhering to the same-origin policy.
